My solutions in this course.

* w2: expectation-maximization algorithm. Implementation of E-step and M-step in a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

* w4: Markov Chain Monte Carlo. MCMC and metropolis-hastings sampling for logistic regression with PyMC3 library.

* w6: Gaussian processes and Bayesian Optimization. Implementation of:
    * Gaussian Process regression with RBF kernel; optimization of lengthscale and variance of kernel.
    * Bayesian Optimization for Hyperparameter tuning.
    * Bayesian Optimization for latent code in a VAE for face generation.
